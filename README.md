Analysis & Predictive Modelling for Heart Disease and Stroke Mortality Rates Among U.S. Adults Aged 35+

The problem is to analyze and understand the variations in heart disease mortality data among adults  in the United States. We’re looking forward to building predictive models to forecast future coronary heart disease and stroke mortality rates based on historical data and relevant features. This is a critical public health initiative as it can help healthcare authorities and policymakers allocate resources, design targeted interventions, and develop preventive strategies to combat these diseases more effectively.

Data
The data sources we are planning to use is “Rates and Trends in Heart Disease and Stroke Mortality Among US Adults (35+) by County, Age Group, Race/Ethnicity, and Sex – 2000-2019” from Data.gov
